Protecting women from deceitful men or criminalizing break-ups? A new law in India stirs debate,2024-08-12,india,"India's new criminal code includes a provision criminalizing sex with a woman under false pretenses of marriage, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. This law aims to address a prevalent form of sexual exploitation where men exploit women's societal pressures and taboos surrounding premarital sex by promising marriage without intending to follow through. While proponents argue it gives women legal recognition for their experiences and strengthens their position in a patriarchal society, critics question the law's effectiveness in proving deceit and intention, potentially leading to misinterpretations and shifting the burden of proof onto the victim. Some also believe the law is outdated in a changing India where dating norms are evolving, questioning its relevance in consensual relationships.

Boeing’s Starliner astronauts may be in space another 6 months. Here’s what they’ll do,2024-08-12,science,"Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, who launched on a test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, may be forced to stay on the International Space Station for an extended period, potentially until early 2025, due to ongoing safety concerns about Starliner. NASA is considering flying the capsule back empty and bringing Williams and Wilmore home on a SpaceX Crew Dragon mission, potentially delaying the Crew-9 mission. If Starliner is deemed unsafe, Williams and Wilmore will become full-time members of the Expedition 72 crew, participating in spacewalks, maintenance, and science experiments. While their stay has been extended, NASA is prioritizing their return due to limited resources on the space station, with a decision about their future expected by mid-August.

New excavations reveal missing pieces of intriguing artifact at Sutton Hoo,2024-08-12,science,"Archaeologists at Sutton Hoo, the site of a famous Anglo-Saxon ship burial in England, have unearthed additional fragments of a Byzantine bucket, adding to previous discoveries of the artifact.  The bucket, depicting a North African hunting scene and featuring a Greek inscription, dates back to the sixth century.  The new research offers insights into the bucket's history, its potential purpose, and the lives of the Anglo-Saxons who may have used it.  Analysis of the soil surrounding the newly discovered fragments could reveal when the bucket was buried and how it was used, while the project as a whole aims to provide a deeper understanding of the prehistoric and early medieval history of the site.

How did ancient Egyptians stack those heavy stones of the oldest pyramid? Scientists float new theory,2024-08-12,science,"A new study suggests that the ancient Egyptians may have used a hydraulic lift device to build the Step Pyramid, the oldest pyramid in Egypt. This theory proposes that water from ancient streams was channeled into a system of trenches and tunnels surrounding the pyramid, creating a water-powered elevator within the pyramid's vertical shaft. While some Egyptologists remain skeptical, the study's authors point to evidence of past wetter conditions in the Sahara and suggest that flash floods could have provided enough water to power the lift. This theory challenges the widely accepted belief that ramps and haulage devices were solely responsible for the construction of the pyramids, and further research is needed to determine if this method was also used for other pyramids.

"Ancient pot of gold unearthed in Turkey hints at ‘gravest misfortune,’ researchers say",2024-08-12,science,"An ongoing excavation at an ancient Greek city in western Turkey has uncovered a treasure trove of artifacts, including a pot filled with gold coins dating back to the fifth century BC.  The coins, known as Persian darics, were buried beneath the floor of an ancient courtyard house, likely intentionally hidden for over 2,000 years. The discovery is considered rare as archaeological excavations rarely uncover such valuable hoards. Researchers believe the coins may have been the savings of a wealthy citizen or perhaps a mercenary soldier during a time of conflict between the Greek and Persian empires.  The find provides valuable insights into the city's history and the economic practices of the era, offering clues about the use of gold and silver coinage.

This conclusion is supported by the discovery of a humerus bone belonging to a 3-foot-tall adult who lived 700,000 years ago, making it the smallest human limb bone ever found. These findings provide more insight into the evolution and adaptation of this unique species.

"‘Cruisezilla’ passenger ships have doubled in size since 2000, environmental group warns",2024-08-12,travel,"A new report from the European clean energy lobby group Transport and Environment warns that the rapid growth of the cruise industry, with ships doubling in size over the past two decades, could lead to even larger vessels in the future.  The report predicts that the biggest cruise ships in 2050 could be nearly eight times larger than the Titanic, raising concerns about the environmental impact of the industry's expanding footprint. While the cruise industry trade association, CLIA, disputes the report's claims, arguing that emissions have decreased and that the industry is committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, T&E highlights the increasing CO2 emissions from cruise ships and calls for a possible tax on cruise tickets to address the industry's environmental impact.

While markets have recovered somewhat since Monday's dramatic losses, with the S&P 500 rising 2.3% on Thursday, some investors remain cautious due to the uncertainty surrounding the yen carry trade and the volatile trading environment in August.

Customers didn’t stop spending. Companies stopped serving,2024-08-12,business,"While CEOs are complaining about a customer ""pullback"" and declining sales in some sectors, a closer look reveals that Americans are simply shifting their spending habits rather than experiencing a significant economic downturn.  The US economy is still strong, with job growth and wages outpacing inflation. Consumers are becoming more discerning and choosing higher-quality experiences like Texas Roadhouse over cheaper options like McDonald's. The travel industry is seeing a softening of demand, but this is relative to the huge post-pandemic surge and not necessarily indicative of a broader trend.  Airbnb is struggling as its pricing and service have become less appealing, while hotel chains continue to see strong demand. Disney's theme park business has also seen a slowdown, possibly due to high prices, complicated booking processes, and a perceived decline in the ""magic"" of the experience. Ultimately, the consumer pullback might be more about businesses needing to adapt to changing consumer preferences and expectations rather than a sign of a looming economic crisis.
